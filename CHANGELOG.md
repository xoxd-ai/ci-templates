Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning: [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.14.1] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Organisation repoint (operator ruling CT1, 2026-09-21, TIN-4435). The
  organisation renamed from tinyland-inc to xoxd-ai and GitHub does not follow
  the rename for `uses:` action resolution, so every consumer pinned to a v2
  tag failed at Set up job. Every internal `uses:` now names
  `xoxd-ai/ci-templates/...@v2.14.1` (the legacy floating `@v2` self-refs and
  the `@v2.12.1` restricted closure are raised to this exact release), the
  run-time raw fetch, the workflow input defaults, the repo manifest owner
  fields and the validators' own patterns and release constants name the new
  organisation and this release. The restricted contract's legacy workflow
  byte pins are re-pinned to the repointed bytes. No behaviour change.

## [2.14.0] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Rust+Bazel native jobs now own all local Bazel state** — the release-vendored
  driver binds `XDG_CACHE_HOME` and Bazel's `--output_user_root` to the fresh
  per-job root under `RUNNER_TEMP`. Persistent native runners can no longer
  inherit a user-level XDG cache or write action/output state into another
  job's Bazel tree.

### Added

- **Opt-in native Rust+Bazel application workflow** — add
  `rust-bazel-application.yml` and its dependency-free finite-target contract
  for the Prompt Pulse Bazel 9 canary. The workflow defaults disabled and takes
  a caller-supplied native Darwin/Linux matrix and Bazel platform facts. A
  hosted no-checkout/no-secret preflight rejects public and fork events, while
  its owner-group contract rejects hosted/repo-shaped native labels, wildcard
  targets, and invalid matrices before private-runner scheduling. Lane
  validation verifies tracked `.bazelversion`, Bzlmod, Cargo, and crate-universe
  lock authority and runs exact Bazel rustfmt, clippy, build, unit, integration,
  and package targets through immutable action references. GloriousFlywheel cache
  attachment is a second default-off input: read and write credentials are
  separate, pull requests can receive only server-enforced read authority, and
  write materialization additionally requires explicit caller approval, a push
  event, and GitHub's protected-ref signal on the configured main branch or
  release tag. All Bazel invocations ignore caller rc files, then apply the
  complete cache-only policy explicitly. Before caller checkout, a dedicated
  custody action validates an operator-projected, root-owned raw Bazelisk
  Nix-store path and refuses PATH, symlink, or mutable substitutes. Run-scoped
  Bazelisk state, an exact validated version, wrapper suppression,
  `.bazeliskrc` refusal, and scrubbing of every rules_rust 0.73
  repin/generator override prevent caller or cross-run binary/dependency
  substitution. Job-scoped XDG and Bazel output roots also prevent local
  action/output state from escaping into a persistent runner-user cache. No
  endpoint, package publish, or four-platform claim is baked into the template.

- **Opt-in tokenless Attic read degrade** — `nix-setup`, `nix-build`, and
  `greedy-cache` previously gated the Attic substituter
  (`extra-substituters` / `extra-trusted-public-keys`) on `ATTIC_TOKEN`
  being present, so a tokenless consumer got zero substituter and silently
  ate a 100% cache miss. New input `attic-public-read` on all three,
  **default `"false"`** — with it unset, execution is byte-identical to the
  pre-existing behavior (rule 2, `AGENTS.md`): no fallback endpoint, no new
  `nix.conf` writes, no new env exports, no new warnings beyond the
  pre-existing ones.

  Set `attic-public-read: "true"` to opt in: when no `attic-server` input
  and no auto-detected `ATTIC_SERVER` resolves, `nix-setup` falls back to
  the tinyland-inc public-read `main` cache
  (`https://nix-cache.tinyland.dev`,
  `main:eaUydxuDu7xBoy5cCo3MdknYAkVyTIASQ7DGuwxa+XA=`) and configures it as
  an anonymous, tokenless, **read-only** substituter — this fallback never
  exports `ATTIC_SERVER`, so it cannot flip `nix-build`'s
  token+server-gated push step from skipped to firing for a spoke that has
  `ATTIC_TOKEN` set but no configured push destination. The new
  `attic-public-key` input (also default `""` on all three) lets a caller
  pin a key for their own tenant `attic-server` under the same opt-in; the
  baked tinyland-inc key is only ever used for the tinyland-inc default
  itself, never baked in for an arbitrary server. `ATTIC_TOKEN` continues
  to gate the authenticated push/login half exactly as before in
  `nix-build` and `greedy-cache`; absent, under the opt-in, with a
  read-only substituter actually configured, both emit a loud
  `::warning::Attic token absent — anonymous public read only, pushes
  disabled` (skipped when the caller passed `push-cache: false`) instead of
  a hard failure or a silent no-op.

### Removed

- **TIN-489: zero-caller TTL half of the deprecated lane family evicted from
  `main`** — `spoke-lane-ttl-reap.yml`, the `lane-ttl-reap` composite action,
  and `schemas/lane-ttl-reap-dispatch.schema.json` (the composite was its only
  consumer; GFTB, transfemme-tailoring, and blahaj vendor their own copies).
  Estate-wide code search (tinyland-inc + Jesssullivan + Great-Falls-Tool-Bus,
  positive-controlled against known `spoke-ci.yml` callers) found zero
  workflow callers for any of the three; the blahaj receiver they dispatched
  to was already evicted (blahaj #1255). Released tags retain the files, so
  pinned callers are unaffected. **Kept on `main`**: `spoke-lane-env.yml`,
  `spoke-lane-env-restricted.yml`, `lane-dispatch`, `lane-reap` —
  `darkmap.phasi.space` still calls `spoke-lane-env.yml@v2` (a moving major
  tag), so evicting that half before the spoke-side sender cleanup would break
  it at the next `v2` re-point. Do not re-point `v2` past a future eviction of
  that half until the darkmap sender is retired.

### Fixed

- **`spoke-lane-env` default-off digest re-recorded (TIN-3903)** — the
  TIN-489 deprecation banner added to `.github/workflows/spoke-lane-env.yml`
  (#122) changed the file's bytes without re-pinning
  `SPECS["spoke-lane-env"][:legacy_sha256]` in
  `scripts/restricted-workflow-contract.rb`, so `just check` failed on a clean
  `main` with `legacy workflow bytes changed (8e7e444f…); default-off proof
  invalid` — a fleet-wide gate, not a local one. Re-recorded the pin
  `759ebf6d…` → `8e7e444f…`. The #122 edit is six leading `#` comment lines
  and nothing else: the diff of both revisions with comment and blank lines
  stripped is empty (157 significant lines on each side), and the parsed YAML
  documents compare equal — identical `on:` / `workflow_call` inputs and
  secrets, `permissions`, `concurrency`, the same six jobs in the same order,
  and byte-identical `if:` guards. The default-off proof the digest anchors is
  therefore unchanged; only the bytes it is taken over moved. The `spoke-ci`
  pin was verified still current and is untouched.

## [2.13.0] — 2026-08-06

### Deprecated

- **Docs-only (TIN-489): PR-env producer routing points at the owner overlay** —
  `spoke-lane-env.yml` and `spoke-lane-env-restricted.yml` now carry
  DEPRECATED headers; the README quick start, composite-action and workflow
  tables, `docs/migration-v0-to-v1.md`, and `docs/restricted-private-runners.md`
  mark the Blahaj-dispatch PR-env path retired-era. The PR-env lifecycle
  producer is the product's owner-overlay repository — see site.scaffold
  `docs/patterns/owner-overlay-apply-plane.md`. The vendored
  `schemas/blahaj-dispatch.schema.json`,
  `schemas/lane-ttl-reap-dispatch.schema.json`, and
  `schemas/public-preview-dispatch.schema.json` are marked retired-era
  historical artifacts (the scaffold #119 recut deleted their upstream
  sources): each schema's top-level `description` now opens with a
  RETIRED-ERA HISTORICAL ARTIFACT note pointing at the owner-overlay
  producer (`description` is a non-validating annotation, so validation
  behavior is unchanged). The "pending scaffold #119 recut" phrasing is
  corrected repo-wide: #119 merged 2026-08-06 (`8862f359`). Zero
  behavioral diff: released action/workflow behavior is untouched and
  everything stays callable.

- **Docs-only (TIN-3066): blahaj receiver path marked retired-era** — README,
  the `lane-dispatch` / `lane-reap` / `lane-ttl-reap` / `public-preview-dispatch`
  action descriptions, the `spoke-lane-env` / `spoke-lane-ttl-reap` /
  `spoke-public-preview` workflow headers, `docs/roadmap.md`, and
  `docs/spec/dev-remote.md` now carry a Superseded (2026-08-05) banner: the
  blahaj receiver path was evicted (blahaj #1255); lane lifecycle belongs to
  the app owner overlay — see site.scaffold
  `docs/patterns/owner-overlay-apply-plane.md` and the scaffold #119 recut
  (merged 2026-08-06, `8862f359`). Zero behavioral diff: released
  action/workflow behavior is untouched (spokes pin immutable tags); the
  behavior recut ships via the versioned release train.

## [2.12.2] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **`gf-credhelper-install` authenticated asset supply path (TIN-3066)** — the
  action fetched the release binary from the public
  `github.com/<repo>/releases/download/...` URL, which 404s unconditionally now
  that `tinyland-inc/GloriousFlywheel` is private, breaking every consumer of
  the non-Nix credhelper distribution channel. A new optional `token` input
  resolves the asset by name through `GET /repos/{repo}/releases/tags/{tag}`
  and downloads it from the per-asset REST endpoint with
  `Accept: application/octet-stream`. The public path is byte-for-byte
  unchanged when no token is supplied, and both paths still sha256-verify the
  fetched bytes against the caller-supplied pin before `chmod`/PATH exposure.

## [2.12.1] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- **Restricted workflow transitive immutability (TIN-3209)** — close the full
  `spoke-ci-restricted.yml` / `spoke-lane-env-restricted.yml` dependency graph:
  self-actions use exact `v2.12.1` refs, verified `actions/checkout` v6.1.0 and
  Determinate Nix use full commit SHAs, the cache attachment contract runs from
  a release-vendored composite, and TruffleHog/Gitleaks release archives are
  downloaded without pipe-to-shell and SHA-256 verified before exact-member
  extraction. The offline restricted-workflow validator now traverses and pins
  the exact action closure, proves the cache composite's exact input/env/path/
  label-export/strict-execution sequence, and permits only one exact scanner
  download/checksum/extract/install sequence. Negative controls reject missing,
  conditional, alternate, duplicate, decoupled, or reordered execution paths.

## [2.12.0] — 2026-07-31

### Added

- **Default-off private-group spoke workflows (TIN-3209)** — add
  `spoke-ci-restricted.yml` and `spoke-lane-env-restricted.yml` as explicit
  private-repository opt-ins. Every directly defined job uses a required owner
  `-infra` runner group plus an exact reviewed capability label; fork and
  untrusted `pull_request_target` execution is rejected before checkout. The
  job-level pre-scheduling condition also admits only the reviewed
  `tinyland-infra` group and exact role labels, so Default/shared/hosted/wrong
  caller routes skip before any runner assignment. The
  original spoke workflows are checksum-pinned byte-for-byte, so existing
  consumers remain unchanged. The operator guide records the owner-overlay →
  immutable ci-templates release → pinned app-caller sequence and makes clear
  that source intent is not live runner-group proof or application authority.

### Fixed

- **No implicit hosted release jobs (TIN-3209)** — retire the repository-local
  PR/main release workflow and stop `npm-publish.yml` from auto-running on
  ci-templates tags or manual dispatch. Immutable library releases are now an
  attended signed-tag/GitHub-release transaction; the existing hosted npm
  workflow remains callable only by already pinned consumers.

- **Structured `runs-on` linting** — teach `lint-runs-on.rb` to inspect GitHub's
  `{group, labels}` form as a mapping, reject missing/generic groups and hosted
  labels inside group mappings, hard-fail forbidden literal fallbacks such as
  `inputs.runner_group || 'Default'`, and retain fail-closed capability-label
  checks instead of stringifying the mapping.

## [2.11.0] — 2026-07-10

### Added

- **`gf-credhelper-install` composite action** — installs the released
  `gf-reapi-credhelper` binary for the current runner platform from a pinned
  GloriousFlywheel release, verifies a caller-supplied SHA-256 before the binary
  reaches `PATH`, and exports `GF_REAPI_CREDENTIAL_HELPER_BIN` for
  `flywheel-github-oidc-profile.sh` plus the compatibility alias
  `GF_REAPI_CREDENTIAL_HELPER`. This is the reusable non-Nix consumer surface
  for the TIN-2724 enforce-cell `:8980` proof path.

- **`authorities.artifact_registry` manifest key** — new optional string
  authority in `schemas/tinyland-repo-manifest.schema.json`, distinct from
  `authorities.package_registry`. `package_registry` keeps its Bzlmod
  source-dependency-registry meaning (`tinyland-inc/bazel-registry`);
  `artifact_registry` names the published-artifact serving/gating surface (the
  Pulp registry — signed, versioned RELEASE artifacts over dnf/podman/https).
  Additive + optional (manifests without it still validate); resolves the
  long-standing `package_registry` naming overload before any consumer sets a
  value. Anchors the Cordillera registry charter (TIN-2718). The value lands
  separately in `rockies/tinyland.repo.json`.

### Fixed

- **Org-namespaced Flywheel runner guards** — `flywheel-bazel` and the
  cache-attachment contract now consume the same TIN-2353 runner-class grammar
  as `nix-setup` / `lanes.schema.json`, so tenant pools such as
  `great-falls-tool-bus-nix` and `medical-massage-specialists-docker` are
  treated as real cluster classes instead of being rejected by stale
  tinyland-only downstream guards.

- **Cloudflare Pages wrapper docs** — the consumer example now matches the
  first live downstream adoption (GFTB PR #28): callers pass job-level
  `contents: read` / `deployments: write`, use `secrets: inherit`, and do not
  duplicate the reusable workflow's `cloudflare-pages-${{ github.ref }}`
  concurrency group. Duplicating that group deadlocks the caller against the
  called `deploy` job before any build step runs.

## [2.10.0] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`spoke-deploy-cloudflare-pages.yml` reusable workflow** — a sanctioned,
  opt-in Cloudflare Pages deploy lane that DRYs the hand-rolled CF-Pages
  publisher copied into ≥3 spokes: GFTB `greatfallstoolbus.org`
  (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`), `transscendsurvival.org`
  (`cloudflare-pages-shadow.yml`), and the `site.scaffold`
  `docs/deploy/cloudflare-pages.md` template block. It builds the adapter-static
  `build/` via `nix develop --command just setup/check/build` (with
  `setup_command` / `check_command` / `build_command` inputs defaulting to
  `just setup` / `just check` / `just build`), exposes declared host
  `node_version` / `pnpm_version` inputs for the Cloudflare action environment,
  resolves `project_name`
  (input; defaults to the slugified repo name) and the deploy branch (from
  `github.head_ref || github.ref_name`, lowercased/sanitized), credential-skips
  with a `::notice::` when `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` are
  absent, and never deploys or mutates on PR events. `secrets:` are declared
  `required: false`; `permissions:` are `contents: read` + `deployments: write`.
  This is the CF-Pages opt-in — it does **not** replace the scaffold default
  GitHub-Pages lane. GFTB and transscendsurvival can adopt it in follow-ups by
  collapsing their inline copies into a thin `uses:` wrapper.

## [2.9.1] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **`flywheel-reapi-proof` pending-cancel retry** — callers may opt into
  `retry_cancelled_before_start: true` (with `max_attempts`, default `3`) so a
  GF proof dispatch cancelled before GitHub assigns a job can be retried with a
  fresh request id. This targets GitHub Actions concurrency pending-slot eviction
  only; existing callers are byte-identical unless they opt in.

## [2.9.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`heavy_runner_class` / `kvm_runner_class` spoke-ci inputs** — the `bazel-graph`
  and `playwright` jobs hard-coded `tinyland-nix-heavy` / `tinyland-nix-kvm`, labels
  only the tinyland-inc pool publishes. Org-scope ARC tenancies riding the TIN-2299
  sense-3 overlay serve a single capability label (e.g. Great-Falls-Tool-Bus serves
  only `tinyland-nix`), so both jobs queued forever on any spoke in such an org
  (observed live: greatfallstoolbus.org PR #2, run 28607136454). Two new optional
  inputs default to the previous hard-coded values — pinned consumers are
  byte-identical until they opt in.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added

- **`scaffold_tag` in the repo-manifest schema (TIN-2229)** — optional, additive
  top-level string property recording the `site.scaffold` release tag a repo was
  spawned from. `site.scaffold`'s `rebrand.sh` stamps it; `tinyland-scaffold-doctor`
  Layer 2 reads it for the version-drift diff. Backward-compatible — manifests without
  it still validate. The floating `@v2` tag needs a new `v2.x` release to ship it.

### Fixed

- **Release workflow floating-major tag movement** — release automation now
  captures the current remote `vMAJOR` tag object before retagging and pushes the
  floating major tag with an explicit lease. This prevents the partial-release
  failure seen during `v2.7.0`, where the immutable tag was created but moving
  `v2` failed with stale tag state.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Flywheel profile-state propagation for cache-backed enrollment (TIN-2130)** —
  cache-backed `js-bazel-package.yml` and `spoke-ci.yml` lanes now export
  `GF_FLYWHEEL_PROFILE_STATE` from the manifest-driven substrate mode, and the
  fail-closed cache attachment contract rejects contradictory profile states.
  This gives consumer `flywheel-doctor` / `flywheel-verify` tooling the same
  machine-readable attachment state as CI without minting tokens or changing the
  cache-first/no-executor boundary.

### Fixed

- **Flywheel advertised-path executor config for fresh-repo proofs
  (TIN-2162)** — the `flywheel-executor` template now forces remote executor
  mode without exposing a consumer-visible platform repository, and release
  validation asserts the template stays executor-backed. This keeps
  enroll/doctor/verify consumers on the advertised GloriousFlywheel path instead
  of requiring repo-local Bazel platform wiring.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Opt-in shared-cache enrollment gate for `spoke-ci.yml` (TIN-2119)** — the
  SvelteKit spoke wrapper gains two operator inputs, `cache_backed` (boolean,
  default `false`) and `substrate_mode` (string, default `""`), plus a
  `cache_backed_targets` input (default the SvelteKit flywheel-eligible CAS
  surface `//:node_modules //:sveltekit_types //:svelte_check_test`). When
  `cache_backed=true`, the `flywheel-build` and `bazel-graph` jobs additionally:
  (a) switch their Nix setup from `setup-nix@v2` (install-only) to
  `nix-setup@v2`, which probes cluster DNS and exports `BAZEL_REMOTE_CACHE` /
  `ATTIC_SERVER` — the spoke wiring fix, since `setup-nix` does not export the
  cache endpoint; (b) validate `tinyland.repo.json` via `repo-manifest-validate@v2`
  and assert shared-cache attachment with the reused
  `scripts/cache-attachment-contract.sh --strict` (manifest-driven expected mode
  `enrollment.substrateMode` > `substrate_mode` input > `shared-cache-backed`
  default; fail-closed on missing/invalid endpoint, non-grpc/http scheme, and
  hosted / repo-shaped runner fallback); and (c) run a cache-backed Bazel build
  of the flywheel-eligible targets with
  `--config=ci-cached --remote_cache=$BAZEL_REMOTE_CACHE
  --remote_upload_local_results=false`, reading the shared Bazel cache.
  CACHE-FIRST only (TIN-1997 Option D): no remote executor is wired. The default
  path (`cache_backed=false`) is byte-identical for the ~34 non-opted spoke
  consumers — all new steps are conditional and the existing setup/build steps are
  unchanged. Reuses the v2.5.1 contract, manifest schema, validator, and
  hosted-runner rejection verbatim (no fork). An opted spoke must also set
  `flywheel_config: flywheel` so `flywheel-bazel` forwards the remote cache.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **`repo-manifest-validate` runs without `jsonschema` or `nix` (TIN-2109)** —
  the action now validates via a bundled, dependency-free stdlib validator
  (`scripts/manifest-schema-validate.py`) that prefers the authoritative
  `jsonschema` package when importable and otherwise falls back to a faithful
  JSON-Schema-2020-12 subset validator. The previous `nix develop --command
  python3` fallback failed on nix self-hosted cluster runners (a cold
  `nix develop` hits an `opening lock file ".../big-lock": Permission denied`),
  which made the v2.5.0 cache-backed manifest-validation gate fail closed for the
  wrong reason. No network; fail-closed semantics unchanged.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **First-class enrollment manifest fields (TIN-2109)** —
  `schemas/tinyland-repo-manifest.schema.json` gains an optional, additive
  `enrollment` object promoting the four GloriousFlywheel enrollment dimensions
  (`forgeScope`, `operatorOverlay`, `executionPool`, `substrateMode`) from
  `supply_chain.sbom.notes` prose to validated fields. `substrateMode` is an enum
  (`compatibility-local-only` | `shared-cache-backed` | `executor-backed`). The
  object is back-compatible: existing manifests without it still validate, and it
  is not globally required.
- **Manifest-driven, fail-closed enrollment gate (TIN-2109)** — when
  `cache_backed: true`, `js-bazel-package.yml` now (1) validates the consumer's
  `tinyland.repo.json` against the vendored schema and **fails closed** on an
  invalid manifest; (2) reads `enrollment.substrateMode` as the **authoritative**
  expected mode fed to `cache-attachment-contract.sh --strict` (a manifest
  declaring `shared-cache-backed` while no cache attaches fails closed, instead
  of the previous hard-coded workflow default); and (3) feeds the runner labels
  so the contract **rejects hosted (`ubuntu-*`) / bare `self-hosted` /
  repo-shaped (`<name>-nix*`) runner fallback** — a missing substrate is a
  deterministic failure, never a silent degrade to a GitHub-hosted build. All new
  steps live inside the opt-in `cache_backed` path; the default
  `bazelisk build … --verbose_failures` step is byte-identical for non-opted
  consumers.
- **`substrate_mode` workflow input** — optional operator override for the
  cache-backed lane's expected mode, used only when the consumer manifest does
  not declare `enrollment.substrateMode` (which remains authoritative). No effect
  on the default path.
- **Executor-backed contract DEFINED + ENFORCED (cache-first, never selected)** —
  `scripts/cache-attachment-contract.sh` now requires the full executor contract
  (remote executor endpoint + `BAZEL_REMOTE_CACHE` + a cluster runner class for
  platform identity + a digest-pinned REAPI proof image via
  `GF_BAZEL_REAPI_PROOF_IMAGE_DIGEST`) whenever the declared/effective mode is
  `executor-backed`, failing closed if any piece is missing. No current repo
  selects executor-backed (TIN-1997 Option D / cache-first); the contract is
  defined so the gate is enforceable the moment a repo declares it. The workflow
  remains executor-free (no `--remote_executor` / `BAZEL_REMOTE_EXECUTOR` /
  `--config=executor-backed`), keeping the `cache-backed-optin-contract` guard
  green.

### Changed

- **Pinned the cache-attachment-contract fetch fallback** in
  `js-bazel-package.yml` from the floating `CI_TEMPLATES_REF=v2` major tag to the
  immutable releasing tag `v2.5.0`, so pure-consumer spokes that have not
  vendored the script get a reproducible fetch.
- **`just check` / `validate-ci-templates.py cache-backed-optin-contract`** now
  additionally asserts the manifest-validation step, manifest-driven expected
  mode, runner-label rejection wiring, the pinned (non-floating) fetch fallback,
  and the contract script's hosted-runner + executor-backed enforcement.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **`lint-runs-on` composite action + `scripts/lint-runs-on.rb` runs-on guard** —
  a portable, Ruby-only (zero Python/PyYAML/nix) author-time guard that fails any
  workflow `runs-on` using a repo-shaped / project-identity self-hosted label
  (e.g. `jesssullivan-nix-heavy`, `chapel-nix`), bare `self-hosted`, or drift
  baked into a `fromJSON()` fallback — while passing shared `tinyland-*`
  capability labels, GitHub-hosted labels, and runtime-dynamic indirection
  (which WARNs, never FAILs). Adopt with one line:
  `- uses: tinyland-inc/ci-templates/.github/actions/lint-runs-on@v2` (after
  `actions/checkout`). The label taxonomy (`scripts/runner_label_taxonomy.rb`)
  is a faithful, self-test-pinned port of GloriousFlywheel
  `scripts/validate-arc-runner-taxonomy.py::label_errors()`; the guard is the
  first semantic workflow-yaml lint in the repo and is wired into `just check`
  (`lint-runs-on-selftest` + `lint-runs-on-check`). First guardrail of the
  GloriousFlywheel enrollment paradigm (P0 #2 — kills the `runs-on: <repo>-nix`
  mistake at author time). (Landed just after the v2.3.0 cut.)

## [2.3.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added

- **`js-bazel-package.yml` opt-in `cache_backed` shared-cache lane (TIN-2110)** —
  a new boolean input (default `false`). When `true`, Bazel target validation
  runs a fail-closed cache-attachment contract step and then
  `--config=ci-cached --remote_cache=$BAZEL_REMOTE_CACHE
  --remote_upload_local_results=false`, reading the shared Bazel cache
  (cache-first, TIN-1997 Option D / GF#889). When `false`/unset the existing
  `bazelisk build … --verbose_failures` path runs **byte-identically** — zero
  behavior change for the ~190 non-opted consumers. The lane is cache-first only
  and never wires a remote executor.
- **`scripts/cache-attachment-contract.sh`** — shared fail-closed classifier
  generalized from MassageIthaca, aligned to TIN-2108 naming
  (`GF_BAZEL_SUBSTRATE_MODE`; modes `compatibility-local-only` /
  `shared-cache-backed` / `executor-backed`). Rejects unexpanded `${...}`
  placeholders, non-`grpc`/`http` endpoints, localhost without explicit proof,
  executor-without-cache, and executor≠cache mismatches.
- **`bazelrc/ci-cached.bazelrc`** — endpoint-free `--config=ci-cached`,
  `cache-readonly`, and `no-remote-cache` behavior for consumer `.bazelrc`
  files; read-only by default and never executor-selecting.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — agent/operator guide documenting the shared-surface golden
  rules and the cache-first Bazel enrollment doctrine (closes the missing-AGENTS
  AX gap).
- **`just ci-cached-endpoint-free-check` + `just cache-backed-optin-contract-check`**
  — repo-local guards asserting `bazelrc/ci-cached.bazelrc` stays endpoint-free
  and the `cache_backed` lane stays default-off and cache-first (no executor
  wiring in the workflow).

## [2.2.1] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **`secrets-scan` installs both scanners to a job-writable dir** — the v2.2.0
  TruffleHog binary install (and the pre-existing gitleaks install) wrote to
  `/usr/local/bin`, which is not writable by the runner user on the nix
  self-hosted pool (`install: cannot create regular file ...: Permission
  denied`). Both now install into `$RUNNER_TEMP/secrets-scan-bin` and prepend
  it to `$GITHUB_PATH`. The gitleaks write was latently broken on these runners
  too — it just never ran because the Docker-based TruffleHog step failed first.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **`secrets-scan` runs TruffleHog as a pinned binary, not a Docker action** —
  `trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main` is a container action and fails on
  Docker-less self-hosted runners ("failed to connect to the docker API at
  unix:///var/run/docker.sock"), e.g. the tinyland nix compute pool, taking the
  whole `secrets-scan` lane (and its downstream `needs:` jobs) red. The action
  now installs a pinned `trufflehog` binary (new optional `trufflehog-version`
  input, default `3.95.3`) and scans git history directly, mirroring the
  gitleaks binary install in the same action. The gitleaks half and the
  `findings_count` output are unchanged.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **`js-bazel-package.yml` npmjs policy is explicit** — adds
  `npm_publish_mode=required|optional|disabled`. The default remains
  `required` for existing consumers, while Bazel-first packages can make
  npmjs best-effort or disabled when GitHub Packages and the Tinyland Bazel
  registry are the release authority.
- **`js-bazel-package.yml` shared runner labels are guarded** —
  `runner_mode=shared` now rejects an explicitly empty
  `shared_runner_labels_json`, catching missing caller repo variables before the
  workflow silently falls back to the default shared runner class.
- **`js-bazel-package.yml` repo-owned mode uses capability labels** —
  `runner_mode=repo_owned` now requires explicit runner labels that include a
  Tinyland capability class, and docs clarify that repo ownership is a
  registration/trust boundary rather than permission to mint repo-shaped labels.
- **`flywheel-reapi-proof` run correlation is request-id based** — the
  composite now dispatches GloriousFlywheel proof runs with a unique request
  id and resolves the matching child run by run name instead of timestamp-only
  "latest run" selection, so concurrent browser/RBE proof requests cannot watch
  a sibling run.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- **`inherit-scaffold-skills` composite** — pulls
  `plugins/scaffold-core` from `tinyland-inc/site.scaffold` at a pinned tag or
  commit SHA, dereferences skill symlinks, and can materialize
  `.agents/skills` plus `.claude/skills` in consumer spokes. Branch refs such
  as `main` are rejected by default so inherited AX contracts do not drift
  silently.
- **v1 to v2 migration guide** — documents endpoint-free Flywheel behavior,
  scaffold skills inheritance, v2 internal refs, and rollback posture.
- **`public-preview-dispatch` composite + `spoke-public-preview.yml`** —
  reusable dispatch path for explicit public/client review aliases. The payload
  is schema-validated and carries source repo, PR, commit, lane, origin host,
  preview hostname, TTL, and Cloudflare Access allowlist. Spokes request the
  alias; Blahaj owns DNS, Access, Tunnel ingress, and cleanup.
- **`lane-ttl-reap` composite + `spoke-lane-ttl-reap.yml`** — reusable
  scheduled TTL backstop dispatcher. Blahaj owns listing and idempotent
  destruction of expired lane environments.
- **`flywheel-reapi-proof` composite** — reusable dispatcher for
  GloriousFlywheel executor-backed proof workflows. The composite does not
  promote target classes by itself; GF proof artifacts remain authoritative.
- **Public preview and TTL reap schemas** — vendored from the site.scaffold
  contract alongside the existing lane schemas.
- **`repo-manifest-validate` composite + repo manifest schema** — reusable
  validation for `tinyland.repo.json`, including optional role gating such as
  `static-spoke,static-spoke-scaffold`.
- **Repo-local validation contract** — adds `Justfile`, `flake.nix`, and
  `tinyland.repo.json` so this template repo can validate itself the same way
  consuming repos do. `just check` now parses workflow/action YAML, parses
  vendored schemas, validates the repo manifest, checks v2 internal refs, and
  enforces endpoint-free Flywheel defaults plus the canonical Tinyland gitleaks
  working-tree scan.

### Changed

- **Flywheel Bazel binding is endpoint-free** — `bazelrc/flywheel.bazelrc`
  no longer hard-codes `remote_cache`, `remote_executor`, or cache upload
  authority. `flywheel-bazel` now passes `--remote_cache` and
  `--remote_executor` from runtime env/action inputs and fails fast when the
  required endpoint is absent.
- **Reusable workflow internal refs target v2** — v2 workflows and nested
  composites call sibling ci-templates actions through `@v2`, not `@v1`, so a
  `spoke-ci.yml@v2.0.0` consumer receives the endpoint-free Flywheel and
  manifest-validation behavior from the same major release.
- **Internal action refs no longer use `@main`** — nested ci-templates action
  calls now use the current floating major tag, and consumer docs point at
  immutable release tags.
- **Schema validators can fall back to the consumer Nix dev shell** —
  `lanes-load` and `repo-manifest-validate` use host Python when `jsonschema`
  is available and otherwise route through `nix develop --command python3`.
- **`spoke-ci.yml` now validates repo manifests when present** — pre-manifest
  consumers continue with a notice; repos that ship `tinyland.repo.json` must
  declare `static-spoke` or `static-spoke-scaffold` for the spoke workflow.
- **Release PRs may carry an empty Unreleased section** — `release: vX.Y.Z`
  PRs are allowed through the changelog gate when branch protection blocks the
  workflow-driven direct push release path.

### Fixed (v1.1.5)

- **`lane-status-check` composite — use `curl` instead of `gh api`** —
  the action posted per-lane commit statuses via `gh api`, which
  requires the GitHub CLI on the host PATH. On runners where `gh`
  only lives inside the spoke flake's devShell, the call failed with
  `gh: command not found` (exit 127) and turned successful builds
  into fake job failures. Surfaced by darkmap PR #86 / TIN-1414 —
  the `flywheel-build` step's underlying `bazelisk build` succeeded
  (`state: "success"` payload was even emitted), but the `gh api`
  POST that followed killed the job.
  Fix: replaced `gh api` with `curl -X POST` calling the same
  `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/statuses/{sha}` endpoint directly. `curl`
  is ubiquitous on Linux runners and doesn't need a flake devShell.
  Also bumped the `lane-status-check@v1.0.0` pin in `spoke-ci.yml`
  to `@v1.1.5`.

### Fixed (v1.1.4)

- **`flywheel-bazel` composite — route bazelisk through `nix develop`
  when not on host PATH** — the action invoked `bazelisk` directly,
  assuming it lives on the runner's system PATH. On runners that
  declare bazelisk inside the spoke flake's devShell (the Tinyland
  default — every spoke flake adds `bazelisk` to `buildInputs`), the
  bare invocation failed with `bazelisk: command not found` in ~1
  second. Surfaced by darkmap PR #86 / TIN-1407.
  Fix: probe `command -v bazelisk`; if found, invoke directly
  (backward-compatible for runner images that preinstall bazelisk
  system-wide). If absent and `flake.nix` is present, route the call
  via `nix develop --command bazelisk ...`. If neither path is
  available, fail loudly with a clear error.
  Also bumped the `flywheel-bazel@v1.0.0` pin in `spoke-ci.yml` to
  `@v1.1.4` so the wrapper workflow picks up the new behavior.

### Fixed (v1.1.3)

- **`setup-nix` composite — ensure `nixbld` group/users + start the
  daemon if needed** — v1.1.2 introduced `setup-nix` but only handled
  install/detect/feature-flags. On Tinyland self-hosted runners the
  daemon socket wasn't reachable, so `nix develop` fell back to direct
  DB access and the runner user got `error: opening lock file "/nix/var/nix/db/big-lock": Permission denied`.
  Surfaced by darkmap PR #86 (the symptom that v1.1.2 was supposed to
  fix re-appeared at the next step).
  Fix: added the missing pair of steps from
  `GloriousFlywheel/.github/actions/nix-job`:
    1. Create the `nixbld` group and `nixbld1..nixbld32` build users if
       absent (multi-user nix prerequisite).
    2. `nix store ping`; if it fails, `sudo -b $(command -v determinate-nixd) daemon`
       (or `nix-daemon --daemon` as fallback) and wait up to 15 s for
       the socket to come up.
  No behavior change for callers — same workflow inputs, same actions
  block in spoke-ci.yml + spoke-lane-env.yml. Ships as v1.1.3.

### Added

- **`.github/actions/setup-nix/action.yml`** — new composite action that
  detects an existing Nix installation (probes
  `/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin` + `$HOME/.nix-profile/bin`,
  then `command -v nix`). When Nix is preinstalled, adds it to PATH
  and writes a per-user `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` with the requested
  flags. When absent, falls through to
  `DeterminateSystems/determinate-nix-action@v3`. Replaces all 8 use
  sites of `cachix/install-nix-action@v31` in `spoke-ci.yml` (5) and
  `spoke-lane-env.yml` (3).

### Fixed

- **All cachix/install-nix-action call sites** — the cachix action
  aborts hard with `Aborting: Nix is already installed at /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin/nix`
  on self-hosted runners that have Nix preinstalled (the case for
  the Tinyland `tinyland-nix*` runner classes). Subsequent
  `nix develop` then failed with `error: opening lock file "/nix/var/nix/db/big-lock": Permission denied`
  because the runner user wasn't granted access to the daemon
  database that the preinstalled multi-user nix relied on.
  Surfaced by darkmap PR #86 / TIN-1402 (every flywheel-build and
  flywheel-test matrix job failed in ~9 seconds).
  Fix: route all callers through the new `setup-nix` composite,
  which handles both the preinstalled-nix case and the
  no-nix-installed case uniformly.

### Fixed

- **`spoke-ci.yml` — strip literal `${{ ... }}` expressions from
  `inputs.runner_labels_json.description`** — GitHub evaluates
  `${{...}}` inside workflow-level `description:` text at PARSE time
  and rejects expressions that reference contexts not available there
  (`vars`, `secrets`, etc.). v1.1.0 shipped two example expressions
  inside the description, which caused every caller to fail in 0
  seconds with no jobs created. Replaced the embedded expressions with
  plain-text guidance pointing to the README / release notes.
- **`spoke-lane-env.yml` — remove invalid `if-skip:` job key on
  `tailnet-qa`** — `if-skip` is not a valid GitHub Actions keyword.
  Workflow parser rejects with `unexpected key "if-skip" for "job"
  section`. The step-level `if: matrix.lane.e2e` on line 164 already
  handles per-lane gating.

Both bugs surfaced during darkmap M3-completion PR #86 (TIN-1398).
Together they made v1.1.0 unusable for any spoke that calls
`spoke-ci.yml@v1.1.0` or `spoke-lane-env.yml@v1.1.0` directly. Ships
as v1.1.1.

### Changed

- **`spoke-lane-env.yml` — `BLAHAJ_DISPATCH_TOKEN: required: false`** —
  loosen the secret contract so spokes can keep the `pull_request:`
  trigger enabled before Blahaj is installed on the repo. New
  internal `check-blahaj-token` job runs first and gates every
  downstream job's `if:` on token presence — empty token = whole
  pipeline skips cleanly with a `::notice::`, NOT a workflow-file
  parse failure.

  Surfaced by darkmap M6 validation
  ([test PR #82](https://github.com/Jesssullivan/darkmap.tinyland.dev/pull/82)):
  GitHub resolves required secrets at workflow-call PARSE time,
  before the job-level `if:` evaluates. So `required: true` +
  empty caller secret = parse-time failure, and the gate never gets
  a chance to short-circuit. Reversing to `required: false` lets the
  job-level gate actually do its job. Backward-compatible: callers
  that DO have the secret continue to work identically.

### Added

- **`spoke-ci.yml` — new `runner_labels_json` optional input** —
  JSON-array expression evaluated via `fromJSON()` to set the
  per-lane matrix jobs' `runs-on`. When set (non-empty), takes
  precedence over `matrix.lane.runner_class` and
  `default_runner_class`.

  Enables spokes with dynamic runner-class fallback (e.g.
  `runs-on: ${{ fromJSON(vars.PRIMARY_LINUX_RUNNER_LABELS_JSON || '["ubuntu-latest"]') }}`)
  to adopt the `spoke-ci.yml` wrapper without losing graceful
  degradation when cluster labels aren't reachable.

  Surfaced by darkmap M3 partial (TIN-1384). Without this input,
  spokes with their own runner-routing logic (darkmap, MassageIthaca)
  couldn't replace their hand-rolled `ci.yml` with the wrapper.
  Now they can. Backward-compatible: existing callers that leave
  this unset see no behavior change.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-18

### Changed

- **`RELEASING.md` § Release flow** — documented the manual-tag
  fallback (step 3b) for environments where the workflow-driven
  release path (step 3a) doesn't hold. Specifically:
  - Local agent safety hooks blocking direct push to `main` and
    `release/*` branch patterns.
  - GitHub rebase-merge silently dropping empty commits — a
    `release: vX.Y.Z` empty commit landed via rebase-merge leaves
    `main` HEAD with a non-release subject, so `release.yml`'s
    `tag-on-release-commit` job never fires.
  Manual fallback cuts the immutable tag, moves the floating major
  tag, and creates the GH Release with the same CHANGELOG-extracted
  notes the automation would have produced. Surfaced during darkmap
  M1-M6 pilot (`Jesssullivan/darkmap.tinyland.dev` TIN-1381).

### Added

- **`docs/spec/dev-remote.md`** — full design spec for the v1.1+
  `lane-preview-tunnel` composite. Codifies the non-REAPI pathway
  (Blahaj K8s Deployment + tailscale-operator Service), the new
  `<spoke>-dev-env` event_type, the wire schema, lifecycle, auth
  model, and open questions to resolve before v1.1.0. Cross-linked
  from `docs/roadmap.md`. Doc-only — no behavior change.
- **`docs/release-checklist-v1.0.0.md`** — operator-facing
  step-by-step checklist for cutting the v1.0.0 release per
  `RELEASING.md`. Documents the merge → `release: v1.0.0` commit →
  `release.yml` auto-tag sequence, plus the companion-repo
  coordination (site.scaffold, GloriousFlywheel scoped tag,
  `.github` org ruleset application). Doc-only.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-17

First versioned release. All prior consumers were on `@main` and are
treated as v0.x retroactively (see `v0.4.0` below).

### Added

- **Workflow `release.yml`** — two-mode: on PR, assert `## [Unreleased]`
  is non-empty (forces CHANGELOG discipline); on push to `main`, if the
  head commit is `release: vX.Y.Z` then cut the immutable `vX.Y.Z` tag,
  move the floating `@vX` major tag, and create a GitHub Release with
  notes extracted from this CHANGELOG. Does NOT auto-tag arbitrary
  merges — matches the RELEASING.md flow.
- **Composite action `flywheel-bazel`** — wraps `bazelisk` with
  `--config=flywheel` (cache-only) or `--config=flywheel-executor`
  (cache + REAPI executor). Refuses executor mode on non-cluster runners.
  Ships embedded `bazelrc/flywheel.bazelrc`.
- **Composite action `lanes-load`** — reads + JSON-Schema-validates
  `.github/lanes.json`, outputs `lanes_json` (for matrix), `styles_json`,
  `lane_count`, `schema_version`, `spoke_name`, `spoke_domain`. Fixes the
  MassageIthaca lane-name duplication bug.
- **Composite action `lane-dispatch`** — constructs + emits the
  `<spoke>-lane-env` `repository_dispatch` to Blahaj (operation:
  `provision`). Validates payload against
  `schemas/blahaj-dispatch.schema.json`. Honors `lane-ttl/<N>d` PR labels.
  Supports `dry_run: true`.
- **Composite action `lane-reap`** — same shape with operation:
  `destroy`. Idempotent.
- **Composite action `lane-status-check`** — posts `ci/lane/<name>`
  GitHub commit status so branch protection can require per-lane checks.
- **Composite action `pulse-ingest-validate`** — wraps the
  `static-projection-snapshot.mts` script so spokes drop the local copy.
- **Reusable workflow `spoke-ci.yml`** — canonical spoke CI:
  secrets-scan → lanes-load → flywheel-bazel-build (per-lane matrix) →
  flywheel-bazel-test (per-lane matrix) → bazel-graph → optional
  playwright. Posts per-lane status checks.
- **Reusable workflow `spoke-lane-env.yml`** — canonical PR-env workflow:
  publish-image (per-lane matrix) → dispatch-apply (single
  `lane-dispatch` call carrying full lanes array) → optional tailnet-qa
  (per-lane matrix filtered to `e2e: true`) → destroy-lanes on PR close.
- **Reusable workflow `spoke-pulse-ingest.yml`** — generalized
  pulse-ingest workflow that opens snapshot-refresh PRs.
- **`schemas/lanes.schema.json`** + **`schemas/blahaj-dispatch.schema.json`** —
  vendored from `tinyland-inc/site.scaffold/docs/schemas/`. Composite
  actions validate inputs/outputs against these.
- **`bazelrc/flywheel.bazelrc`** — embedded Flywheel bazelrc fragment.
  `flywheel-bazel` action installs it to `.bazelrc.flywheel` at run time;
  spokes also vendor a copy and refresh via `just sync-flywheel-bazelrc`.
- **`docs/roadmap.md`** — v1.1+ items including `lane-preview-tunnel`
  (dev-server-on-cluster).
- **`RELEASING.md`** — release flow + SemVer policy.

### Changed

- **`nix-setup`** — added outputs `runner_class`, `attic_reachable`,
  `bazel_cache_reachable` consumed by `flywheel-bazel` for cluster
  detection. Bazel-cache DNS probe added (matching the existing Attic
  probe). Behavior-compatible with v0.x.
- **`secrets-scan`** — added input `extra_paths` (default `""`) for
  per-spoke `.gitleaks.toml` lookups outside the repo root; added
  output `findings_count` parsed from the gitleaks JSON report;
  added a `Secrets scan` block to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. Behavior-
  compatible.
- **`nix-build`**, **`greedy-cache`** — internal `@main` self-references
  bumped to `@v1`.
- **`README.md`** — rewritten with v1.0.0 quick-start + pin banner.

### Migration from `@main`

See [`docs/migration-v0-to-v1.md`](docs/migration-v0-to-v1.md).
TL;DR: `grep -rn 'tinyland-inc/ci-templates.*@main' .github/` and
replace each `@main` with `@v1.0.0`. The four pre-existing composite
actions remain behavior-compatible; new spokes additionally consume
the reusable workflows.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-17 (retroactive baseline)

Snapshot of `@main` at the SHA preceding the v1.0.0 cut. Provided so
consumers on `@main` have a SemVer tag to pin against during migration.
No code changes from the pre-tag `@main` state.

### Pre-existing

- Composite actions `nix-setup`, `nix-build`, `greedy-cache`,
  `secrets-scan`.
- Reusable workflows `js-bazel-package.yml`, `npm-publish.yml`.
