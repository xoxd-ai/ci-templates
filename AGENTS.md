# AGENTS.md — tinyland-inc/ci-templates

Operator/agent guide for the shared Tinyland CI surface. This repo is a
**reusable** GitHub Actions library consumed by ~190 repos. Treat every change as
a fleet-wide change.

## What this repo is

- Reusable **workflows** (`.github/workflows/*.yml` with `workflow_call`) and
  composite **actions** (`.github/actions/*/action.yml`) that spokes pin and
  consume. It is not an application; nothing here deploys.
- The contract spokes conform to lives in
  `tinyland-inc/site.scaffold/docs/CI-SCHEMA.md`. This repo vendors schemas at
  stable paths under `schemas/`.

## Golden rules

1. **Pin, don't float.** Production consumers pin an exact immutable release
   such as `@v2.12.1`; floating `@v2` is a quick-start convenience, not an
   acceptance receipt. The restricted private-runner workflows and their full
   transitive composite closure must use an exact immutable self-release, while
   third-party Actions use full 40-character commit SHAs. The restricted
   closure check rejects `@v2`, `@main`, local consumer-relative actions,
   unpinned third-party Actions, mutable installer scripts, and unverified
   scanner archives.
2. **Default-off, opt-in changes only.** A new behavior added to a shared
   workflow MUST be gated behind a new input that defaults to the pre-existing
   behavior. Non-opted consumers must be byte-identical. Prove it by diffing the
   default execution path. There are two standing exceptions. Rule 3 is a
   prohibition and cannot ship with an opt-out, so TIN-3914 changed default
   routing for every consumer and took a MAJOR bump instead of a gate. TIN-4257
   repairs the already-declared schema-3 export contract by always passing the
   image-custodied client a fresh result directory: a workflow input would
   become a second result-disposition authority beside the ActionPlan. That
   caller repair ships only in a new immutable patch after the provider image
   accepts the flag; it never moves an existing exact tag.
3. **No GitHub-hosted runners, ever.** Operator ruling, 2026-08-19: the estate
   runs ONLY on GF cache-fronted self-hosted runners. Every `runs-on` names an
   org capability class. Three gates, deliberately reading different things:
   `just lint-runs-on-check` verdicts `runs-on` values structurally,
   `just no-hosted-runners-check` scans every schedulable surface textually
   (label-aware and case-insensitive). The v4 action-plan schema cannot express
   a runner at all. There is no opt-out input, and reintroducing one is not a
   local decision. See
   `docs/migration-v2-to-v3.md`.
4. **No baked endpoints, credentials, or upload authority** in `bazelrc/*.bazelrc`
   (enforced by `just endpoint-free-check` + `just ci-cached-endpoint-free-check`).
   Cache/executor endpoints are runtime authority, supplied as flags by the
   composite/workflow from validated env.
5. **Amend `CHANGELOG.md` `## [Unreleased]`** in every feature/fix PR. Release
   PRs move that content into the dated version section.
6. **Run `just check` before pushing** (or `nix develop --command just check`).
   TIN-4257 `3b1d6284` permits one narrow source-validation bootstrap for the
   signed Draft #165 candidate: its exact pushed source runs the unchanged
   complete check through this repository's existing `spoke-ci-v4.yml` direct
   self-CI job on shared `tinyland-nix`. This exception changes check timing,
   not the required verdict; it grants no GF execution, publisher runtime,
   immutable release, or consumer adoption authority.

## Local validation

```bash
just check                       # full suite
nix develop --command just check # if tools are not on PATH
```

`just check` parses all workflow/action YAML + JSON schemas, validates
`tinyland.repo.json`, asserts internal action refs resolve, traverses the
restricted workflows' exact dependency closure, guards the js-bazel-package
runner + cache-backed contracts, asserts the bazelrc fragments stay
endpoint-free, dogfoods the `runs-on` linter at 0 FAIL, proves no GitHub-hosted
runner label survives on a schedulable surface, including canonical consumer
lanes data (`no-hosted-runners-check`, TIN-3914), and runs the gitleaks
working-tree scan.

## V4 action-fabric release (TIN-2130, TIN-4246, TIN-4249)

The only adoption target is ActionPlan/v4 schema 3. The proposed
`spoke-ci-v4.yml@v5.2.0` release remains held under the publisher contract below;
it is not an available adoption pin. An organization installs its own all-repos GF
GitHub App and operates its own owner controller, resolver, and thin
`gf-v4-dispatch` edge. Each application repository contributes only a finite
`.github/lanes.json` and an immutable workflow call. GF and ci-templates never
hold consumer rows, repository enrollment, provider endpoints, or overlay
instances.

The workflow checks out the exact admitted source SHA and invokes one compiled
client command:

```text
/usr/local/bin/gf-action-client run \
  --plan .github/lanes.json \
  --action "$ACTION_NAME" \
  --source-sha "$SOURCE_SHA" \
  --result-dir "$RUNNER_TEMP/gf-action-result-${GITHUB_RUN_ID}-${GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT}-${ACTION_NAME}"
```

The Go client owns OIDC, invocation-time binding, REAPI dispatch, cache reuse,
and `ActionOutputSet/v1` carriage. Bazel actions—not GitHub jobs or ARC pods—are
the compute and scheduling unit. The `gf-v4-dispatch` runner is an org-local
teletype into that fabric, not provider supply.

The same workflow's default-off GF-I09 mode replaces `run` with the compiled
client's `publish-application` command only for a canonical-`main` push with
exact caller-workflow source. GitHub branch-protection metadata is not an
admission prerequisite under the September 8 Free-plan ruling and GF #1817.
The compiled GF publisher retains signed-source and organization admission,
exact OIDC/workflow identity and independent output qualification.
Its separate job alone has `packages: write` and repository-keyed,
non-cancelling concurrency. Publisher callers pin the exact 40-character
release commit because GF-I09 binds the called workflow ref into its OIDC
identity; the SemVer tag remains the ordinary non-publishing adoption form.
Under TIN-4257 and GFTB meta #62 Amendment 6, the compiled publisher must obtain
the authenticated remote runtime base from the exact locked source in that
same invocation, sign it with the same publisher identity, verify registry
readback, and retain its digest in-process. No workflow input, copied digest,
caller-provided layout, workflow-side build, or second action can replace that
transaction. Reviewed materialization bounds remain required.

This publisher CLI matches GF #1837, merged as
`cb893dd68399e5778f32cfa5322729eac60df5b9`: it calls
`PublishInstalledNativeApplication` without a caller-supplied runtime-base
layout. That is source compatibility, not an installed-client or runtime
receipt. Keep the release Draft/no-auto pending the matching installed client,
qualified same-invocation exact-source publication proof, exact-release
registered remote validation and the attended immutable release transaction.
The source merge does not prove publication or serving.

Missing App, overlay revision, owner-supply catalog, dynamic binding, OIDC,
client, REAPI authority, or result is a hard product failure. There is no v4
fallback to a v3 profile or registry, cache-only attachment, local build,
hosted runner, direct endpoint, environment profile, or warning-success path.
Historical cache/profile workflows remain retirement inventory; they are not
an adoption guide and must disappear from a consumer's v4 cutover.

## Releasing

See `RELEASING.md`. Releases are attended operator transactions: enable native
immutable releases, land the dated changelog section, create signed annotated
exact and floating-major tags with an exact lease, then publish and verify the
GitHub release attestation. Never reuse an exact tag.
