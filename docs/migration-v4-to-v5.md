# Migrate ActionPlan/v4 schema 2 to schema 3

ci-templates `v5.2.0` is a proposed, held carrier of schema 3, first
introduced in `v5.0.0`. Its source carries the qualified-result caller repair
described below and a prospective default-off protected application publisher.
Do not adopt the release until the matching installed client and qualified
runtime proof are established, exact-release registered validation passes,
and the attended immutable release exists. Schema 3 is an
incompatible revision of the GloriousFlywheel
`ActionPlan/v4` interface.
The reusable workflow remains the thin `spoke-ci-v4.yml` dispatcher; the
product interface did not become ActionPlan/v5.

Schema 2 omitted result disposition and admitted only Linux demand. Schema 3
makes result handling explicit and admits both provider-blind capability
values. It does not claim either capability has live provider supply.

## Update the checked-in plan

Every action must choose exactly one result mode:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 3,
  "actions": {
    "unit-tests": {
      "command": "test",
      "targets": ["//tests/..."],
      "capability": "rbe-linux-x86_64",
      "result": { "mode": "status-only" }
    },
    "deployment-bundle": {
      "command": "build",
      "targets": ["//deploy:bundle"],
      "capability": "rbe-linux-x86_64",
      "result": {
        "mode": "export-regular-files",
        "output_groups": ["default"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use `status-only` when the caller needs only the REAPI terminal status. It
accepts no `output_groups`. Use `export-regular-files` only for exact Bazel
labels whose selected output groups contain regular files; wildcard and
recursive target patterns are rejected. Directories, trees, symlinks, and
special files are not silently flattened or omitted.

The proposed `v5.2.0` workflow passes every invocation one new result
directory beneath `RUNNER_TEMP`, keyed by run, attempt, and action name. The
ActionPlan remains the sole result-disposition authority. The workflow does not
parse or upload the directory, and its fixed files do not convey GF-I09
publication authority.

The same proposed release adds `publish_application`, default `false`. When
enabled, a protected canonical-`main` push invokes the image-custodied
`gf-action-client publish-application` command instead of `run`; same-repository
pull requests and pushes outside the complete publisher gate still execute the
ordinary non-publishing action. Only the publisher job has
`packages: write`, and its concurrency is repository-keyed with cancellation
disabled. Publication also requires reviewed `materialized_root_max_files` /
`materialized_root_max_bytes` values; their zero defaults refuse publication.
The runtime base must be acquired through the compiled publisher's authenticated
remote subtransaction from exact locked source in the same invocation, signed
under the same identity, and independently verified on registry readback. Its
digest stays in-process, never a caller/workflow input or manually copied
operand. No workflow-side build, caller-provided layout, or second action is a
substitute (TIN-4257; GFTB meta #62 Amendment 6).

GF #1837, merged as `cb893dd68399e5778f32cfa5322729eac60df5b9`, implements
this CLI through `PublishInstalledNativeApplication` without a caller-supplied
runtime-base layout. This is source compatibility only. Keep the release
Draft/no-auto pending the matching installed client, qualified same-invocation
exact-source publication proof, exact-release registered remote `just check`
and dependency-closure proof, and the attended immutable release transaction.
The source merge does not establish activation or runtime evidence.

After those release gates close, the protected caller must grant the same
closed permission set and keep its action and materialization bounds in
reviewed source:

```yaml
jobs:
  deployment-bundle:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
      packages: write
    uses: tinyland-inc/ci-templates/.github/workflows/spoke-ci-v4.yml@REPLACE_WITH_V5_2_0_RELEASE_COMMIT_SHA
    with:
      action_name: deployment-bundle
      publish_application: true
      materialized_root_max_files: <reviewed-integer>
      materialized_root_max_bytes: <reviewed-integer>
```

Do not replace those placeholders until the matching same-invocation remote
producer is available, the immutable release exists, and the application's
actual materialized-root bounds have durable carriers. The
publisher call must use the exact 40-character commit behind the immutable
release: GF-I09 binds `job_workflow_ref` into its signing identity and refuses
a tag-shaped workflow ref.

`rbe-linux-x86_64` and `rbe-darwin-aarch64` express demand only. The signed
provider catalog must supply the chosen capability or resolution fails closed.
Do not add a runner label, local execution, hosted CI, another architecture,
or cache-only path as compensation.

## Move the authority graph atomically

1. Validate the raw schema-3 plan against `schemas/lanes.schema.json`.
2. Publish a new immutable consumer-owned overlay revision if organization
   policy changed. `OwnerInstallation/v1` and `TenantOverlay/v1` authorize the
   organization, workflow/ref/event classes, and capability policy; they never
   enumerate repositories or ActionPlan digests.
3. Provision the `gf-v4-dispatch` runner edge in that organization's runner
   group and require a current `ResolvedOwnerSupplyCatalog/v1`, admitted
   provider supply, and a provider image carrying the schema-3
   `gf-action-client`. The image must accept `--result-dir` before the caller
   pin moves. The client binds the exact repository, source SHA, workflow,
   event, ref, and ActionPlan at invocation time.
4. After the attended immutable release exists, pin the caller to
   `tinyland-inc/ci-templates/.github/workflows/spoke-ci-v4.yml@v5.2.0`; do not
   move or reuse `v5.1.0`.
5. Prove a remote miss with nonzero WorkerLeaf execution and an exact
   `ActionOutputSet/v1` when export was requested. Repeat the identical action
   and prove an ActionCache hit with no execution lease.
6. Delete the schema-2 caller and superseded v3 attachment in the same adoption
   pass. Do not leave either as fallback doctrine.

An absent organization App installation, signed overlay, catalog, dynamic
binding, client, route, worker, CAS object, or output set is a hard failure.
The ci-templates tag proves
immutable workflow source only; it does not prove enrollment, provider
convergence, execution, cache effectiveness, result carriage, or production
serving.
