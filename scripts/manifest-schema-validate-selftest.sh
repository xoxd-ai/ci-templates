#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Negative/positive test harness for scripts/manifest-schema-validate.py.
#
# Three defects this pins down, all of which shipped fleet-wide:
#
#  1. The `repo-manifest-validate` composite hardcoded the v1 schema, so a
#     consumer that had migrated to the published `schema_version` 2 failed the
#     gate with `Additional properties are not allowed` plus `at
#     /schema_version: 1 was expected` — the gate blaming the manifest for a
#     branch the gate did not have. Routing is now total; these cases assert
#     each version reaches ITS schema and that anything unpublished fails
#     loudly with the value it saw rather than being routed to v1.
#
#  2. A dependency-free fallback validator implemented a JSON Schema subset
#     that did not include `not`, `anyOf`, or `contains` — which the v2 schema
#     uses to express every boundary rule (a static spoke must NOT claim
#     apply-plane authority; a layered role MUST contain its layer). Pointed at
#     the v2 schema, that subset returned 0 for manifests the authoritative
#     validator rejects.
#
#     THE FALLBACK IS NOW DELETED (TIN-4132 / TIN-4192), so this file no longer
#     runs every case twice. The differential-lane machinery it used is gone
#     with it: two engines kept in step by a hand-written harness was the
#     hazard, not the fix. What replaces those cases is a REFUSAL contract —
#     with `jsonschema` hidden, the validator must exit 5 naming the dependency
#     and must NOT return a verdict of any kind. Those cases are the ones that
#     fail if a fallback is ever reintroduced, because a fallback would answer
#     0 or 1 where this file demands 5.
#
#     The refusal's own code is asserted too. It was 2 in the first draft,
#     shared with every usage/IO error, and the composite action's `2)` arm
#     therefore reported a malformed `tinyland.repo.json` as a broken runner.
#     Both halves of that split now have cases: refusal is 5, usage/IO is 2.
#
#  3. That same subset compared `const`/`enum` with Python `==`/`in`. `bool`
#     subclasses `int` in Python, so `True == 1`: a manifest declaring
#     `"schema_version": true` satisfied the v1 schema's `{"const": 1}`. Both
#     directions are still pinned below — `true` must be rejected, and `1.0`
#     must still be ACCEPTED, because JSON Schema compares numbers
#     mathematically. `_as_schema_version` applies the same rules to routing,
#     so `2.0` reaches the v2 schema instead of exiting 3 on a document that
#     schema accepts. These now assert the ROUTER against the authoritative
#     engine rather than one engine against another.
#
# Run: scripts/manifest-schema-validate-selftest.sh
# Wired into `just check` via `manifest-validate-selftest`.

# engine present. Collapse them again and one of the two lanes goes red.
